**Labtop Workflow System** is a Java Swing application developed as an academic project to simulate and manage the workflow of a laptop production process. The system demonstrates the implementation of user interfaces and business logic in a desktop application environment.

## üìã Project Overview

This workflow management simulation enables users to:

- Track laptop production steps from design to delivery
- Manage different departments' roles in the production process
- Monitor quality control checkpoints
- Visualize production timelines
- Generate reports on production status

## üöÄ Key Features

### 01. Process Management
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Interface for monitoring all production stages
- **Status Tracking**: Updates on production progress
- **Task Assignment**: Assign responsibilities to departments

### 02. System Architecture

- **UML Class Diagram**: Illustrates the object-oriented design and class relationships of the entire system
- **Workflow Design**: Shows work request relationships between different departments and organizations
- **Data Model**: Demonstrates how data is structured and related throughout the system

The diagram displays:
- Relationships between different enterprise entities (Advertising, Retail, Delivery, Manufacturing, etc.)
- WorkQueue connections between various departments
- How different types of WorkRequests flow through the system

This architecture enables the system to track the complete lifecycle of laptop production and coordinate workflows across departments.

### 03. Additional Features
- **Basic Reporting**: Generate status reports
- **Quality Control Checkpoints**: Track testing results
- **Process Visualization**: View production flow

- Digital Strategy Organization

## üë• Roles & Organizations Matrix

The Labtop Workflow System implements a complex organizational structure with specific roles assigned to each department. Below is a comprehensive mapping of all roles and their corresponding organizations, along with their primary responsibilities in the workflow:

### Role-Department Relationships

| Enterprise | Organization | Role | Primary Responsibilities |
|------------|--------------|------|--------------------------|
| **Technology Product** | Product Management | Product Manager | ‚Ä¢ Creates initial WorkRequests<br>‚Ä¢ Verifies completed development work<br>‚Ä¢ Verifies marketing campaign results |
| **Technology Product** | Research & Development | RD Role | ‚Ä¢ Updates development status<br>‚Ä¢ Provides technical feedback<br>‚Ä¢ Marks development as completed |
| **Technology Product** | Purchasing | Purchase Manager | ‚Ä¢ Creates PurchaseWorkRequests<br>‚Ä¢ Approves manufacturing price quotes<br>‚Ä¢ Verifies completed production |
| **Technology Product** | Marketing | Marketing Manager | ‚Ä¢ Creates MarketingWorkRequests<br>‚Ä¢ Sets marketing budgets<br>‚Ä¢ Evaluates advertising performance |
| **Manufacturing** | Manufacturing Manager | Manufacturing Manager | ‚Ä¢ Provides production price quotes<br>‚Ä¢ Signs shipping agreements<br>‚Ä¢ Creates DeliveryWorkRequests |
| **Manufacturing** | Production Line | Manufacturing Worker | ‚Ä¢ Updates production status<br>‚Ä¢ Tracks manufactured quantities<br>‚Ä¢ Reports manufacturing completion |
| **Delivery** | Delivery Manager | Delivery Manager | ‚Ä¢ Sets shipping prices<br>‚Ä¢ Allocates delivery resources<br>‚Ä¢ Manages delivery logistics |
| **Delivery** | Deliver | Delivery Role | ‚Ä¢ Updates shipping status<br>‚Ä¢ Handles physical deliveries<br>‚Ä¢ Reports completed deliveries |
| **Retail** | Retail Sales | Retail Manager | ‚Ä¢ Confirms receipt of products<br>‚Ä¢ Initiates marketing workflows<br>‚Ä¢ Manages retail inventory |
| **Advertising** | Planner | Advertising Manager | ‚Ä¢ Reviews marketing requests<br>‚Ä¢ Signs or rejects campaigns<br>‚Ä¢ Allocates advertising resources |
| **Advertising** | Digital Strategy | Digital Ads Strategist | ‚Ä¢ Executes marketing campaigns<br>‚Ä¢ Tracks budget utilization<br>‚Ä¢ Reports on campaign performance |

### WorkRequest Flow & Role Interactions

The system orchestrates complex interactions between these roles through specialized WorkRequest objects:

1. **DevelopmentWorkRequest Flow**:
   - Created by: Product Manager
   - Processed by: RD Role
   - Verified by: Product Manager

2. **PurchaseWorkRequest Flow**:
   - Created by: Purchase Manager
   - Price quoted by: Manufacturing Manager
   - Signed by: Purchase Manager
   - Executed by: Manufacturing Worker
   - Verified by: Purchase Manager

3. **DeliveryWorkRequest Flow**:
   - Created by: Manufacturing Manager
   - Price quoted by: Delivery Manager
   - Signed by: Manufacturing Manager
   - Executed by: Delivery Role
   - Confirmed by: Retail Manager

4. **MarketingWorkRequest Flow**:
   - Created by: Marketing Manager
   - Signed by: Advertising Manager
   - Executed by: Digital Ads Strategist
   - Verified by: Marketing Manager

This interdependent role structure ensures proper handoffs between departments and maintains accountability throughout the laptop production lifecycle.
